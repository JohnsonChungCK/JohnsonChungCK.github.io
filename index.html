	<h1>Hi! Iâ€™m Johnson Chung.</h1>

	<p1>I am a Wildlife Conservationist dedicated to wetland and bird conservation. 
	Over the past 10 years, I've worked on various wetland conservation projects including 
	habitat restoration, bird monitoring, environmental education and community engagement programs. 
	I am also an amateur wildlife photographer. Posting photos with stories behind the scenes to 
	everyone is an excellent way to share the fun and marvellous nature. I explored various habitats 
	via wildlife observation and photography, in over ten countries worldwide.
